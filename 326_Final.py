When all of that shit went down, I was really hoping that we could’ve ended it in somewhat of a civil way out of respect for whatever memories we had but you’ve made it clear from the beginning that you’ve never cared. I find it so laughable that you attempted to be offended when I told you that one time that I was always on guard for you to fake again and not give a shit. And your little one week experiment to not tell us that Josh is back to prove you’re still around completely backfired. I like to believe that those were your attempts to be somewhat nice but then again I’m not surprised at how it turned out. I talked to Royce and he told me what your take on the whole thing is. I’m not surprised that you’d twist it and make it just about snapping. That I was the crazy one and all I did was complain about how you snapped me and how I was so angry and obsessed for your attention that I blocked you for no reason. Great job leaving out how you continuously used me. And don’t even try to make an excuse that you didn’t use me. I don’t care if you apologized in the past. People apologize and say what they need to take advantage of people. You’ve apologized so many times because you knew what you were doing was fucked up but you never cared. The amount of guys that have came and went since I’ve known you is astonishing, so I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised when it was my turn. Maybe I’ve stuck around longer because you knew deep down it was fun and I was the only one that tried because I actually cared. I’ve told you that every time you came and left it tore me apart. So thanks for putting the nail on the coffin and saying that it was all a mistake. Every single fucking time you were happy again and found someone else to be friends with you bailed on me. And I’m the one obsessed for attention? All you do is call me and bitch and whine about how other people are ignoring you. Royce literally told me he watched your streams and that’s all you fucking do, hilarious. 
Then you want to say that I’m 24 and that I shouldn’t worry about what you, an 18 year old, is thinking?? When did age matter to you all of the sudden?? Is it only 24? Cause your 30-40 year old friend seems to be pretty important. That day you called me about your kiss with Mason I felt like was a growing moment for both of us. You were finally able to think for yourself and do what you want and I was able to apologize and be happy for you after feeling a bit jealous. Out of the whole thing what you took out of it and lied to Royce about was that I was so mad and jealous when you told me. That really shows your true colors and character. I could not believe my ears, I literally laughed out loud. This whole thing I feel like is 50% that you never cared. You are the most hypocritical person that I’ve ever met honestly. I pride myself in being chill and someone that people actually want to talk to. That’s why I was able to block you, I realized that you were just toxic and a complete waste of time. I was actually having fun talking to other people without having to care or think about you. So don’t keep thinking that I’m somehow obsessed. The other 50% I think is that you’re just too hard headed to admit that how you treat people is wrong. I bet no one has ever called you out on your bullshit as much as me and you’re just running from it. So keep on lying and saying whatever you want to help you sleep better at night. Like saying that you have “very good morals” wow. Josh is anyone’s business when you start a friendship with the preface that “you’d choose him over everything”. No one knows what that’s supposed to fucking mean. And that doesn’t give you the right to treat people like shit. I used to not know why I’ve always had this dislike and disgust for Josh because I never properly spoke to the guy. But I’m done being nice about him and I really don’t care if it pisses you off when I talk about him. 
Everyone on younow has had their fair share of catfish experiences. So that’s why I’m disgusted with him. Catfishes are liars, they lie to themselves and they lie to others to get what they want and they immediately bounce when they’re exposed. That was exactly what he did. Josh, I can genuinely say is the biggest loser of them all and he’s only able to keep up this act because of you. I still to this day see him in pretty girls streams doing his thing, pathetic. Do you think any of the other girls he talks to know about his real self? A genuine relationship requires the utmost basic level of human interaction and in 3 years he’s yet to give you that. He’s even manipulated you into crying and thinking that you were wrong for wanting that. But no, he’s perfect and fuck everyone else. Honestly it makes sense that you gravitate towards him, because you yourself are capable of being completely two faced and hurtful. And that’s all you’ll ever get; fake people hurting you. All that talking and crying about separating yourself from him, for nothing. Back to square one, what a shame. So thank you Nat, for making it so that whenever I think back of you, that you were one of the most hurtful and worst persons I’ve ever had to befriend. And if you think I’m being petty, I’m not. I am justifiably attacking your character that I hope one day changes. I’ve always tried my best to be nice and supportive of you; I never ever tried to insult or ridicule you. Even in this I am telling straight up how I feel about the shit you did. But you have done more than enough to me. All in all I was very sad and disappointed, but hey you don’t care. There you go, like you said my last words I had to get out that I couldn’t think of because of how annoyed I was last time we spoke. Don’t get on Royce’s case for any of this, he was just curious himself too how this shit even blew up. He saw the fun and then gone, it makes no sense huh? He still wants to be friends with you. Good luck with life.

Hi Autumn, I’ve been wanting to apologize for the past few days now, but I figured that you were ignoring me. So, I’ll apologize here, and I hope you can read it. I’m sorry for being a creep and saying those things to you last time we called. You were telling me all these stories and even that horrible thing that happened to you in high school. I wasn’t using my head and I wasn’t thinking about your feelings and said that shit like a dumb ass. I was being gross and selfish. I regretted it instantly because I realized it was wrong and again you were nice enough to brush it off and tell me not to worry about it. I know you’ve said in the past that there wasn’t anything I could say to push you away, but I took advantage of that, and I should’ve known better.
You probably don’t want to speak to me anymore, and honestly that’s what I’m truly sad about. I know it probably seemed that I was always trying to push me liking you on you all the time, but if you called earlier, I was planning to tell you that I wanted to drop my stupid crush on you because I didn’t want to lose you as a friend. I love talking to you and getting to know you. I love sharing my own stories with you too. I’m so invested in your job situation and really am wishing you the best. I was really hoping we could sort this out and just go back to being friends because it was never about all that sexual stuff. I genuinely liked you as a person. But now my other friends heard about it, and they don’t want to speak to me anymore. I’m just really sad I’m losing you and them.
I really am sorry that it’s ending this way. I really do hope that you know that I never meant to hurt you or make you uncomfortable. If I can be honest, I really beat myself up that you never felt like you could be straight with me and talk to me. I don’t blame you though. I know it’s awkward to call someone out on something, but I tried my best to show you that you could. It hurts me that everyone decides to just drop me without giving me a heads up or talking to me one last time. Maybe its just me, maybe my idea of friends is just wrong. I was trying to avoid all of this. I always said I was worried that you’d see me as one of those guys that annoy you all the time; I’m sorry for becoming one of those guys. I really do wish you the best with work and everything. I’ll leave you alone now, I won’t bother you anymore.

Hi Kinsey, I hope everything is going well with the semester wrapping up soon. I wanted to apologize again for making you mad and losing your trust. If it counts for anything, I’ve talked to Autumn and apologized and we’re now on good terms. Believe it or not, we’re better now than ever before. We started to talk a lot again and she just makes me happy. I really do like Autumn a lot; she is like the coolest girl ever.  I hope this, in a way, shows that what I did with Autumn was nothing like what I did with Nat. I know what I did with Autumn was wrong and I’m not trying to downplay it, but what I did to Nat was just shameful and gross. When I was in that mindset with Nat, that’s all I was thinking about, and it didn’t matter who it was. That’s why I involved cb and I regretted it because I didn’t even care if I hurt my own friends for some perverted stuff. With Autumn its different, she is the only person that I care for in that way.
The ironic thing about the whole situation is that there was honestly a blessing in disguise. I finally got the final answer on where Nat’s heart was and how my friendship with her truly was like. I finally saw how hateful she can be. From this situation, she was the one that took it the hardest and it did not even directly involve her. Knowing how she is, her priority on this situation was not that I, a “friend”, was doing something wrong. It wasn’t that Autumn was uncomfortable. I feel like for her its just a way to villainize me and invalidate all the stuff I’ve said about her. “Fuck this guy who keeps calling me out for shit, I knew he was a bad person. Nothing he said about me is true”.
Kinsey you know that Nat and I have butt heads for the longest time now. In the beginning it was all my fault, but I did my best to change, and I believe that I have changed. Not a day before the whole thing went down, we were talking normally and guesting on younow; it was fun. After my issue, she has always been the problem. I called her out for being a horrible person time and time again. She knows that she is hateful, and she hates me for pointing it out. For the longest time, I’ve tried to explain to people how manipulative and hurtful she can be, but my feelings never mattered. People invalidate what I say because of what I did to her first. That’s not fair. What I did to her has no correlation to how she treats people, how she uses people. I have stuck around long enough to see the amount of people that have come and gone with her. Obviously, she’s not doing what I did in the past because guys think differently. That’s the thing though, she is a girl and gets a pass. I have so many stories to tell but it’s too much to type. You saw me as a regular guy, but now you think that I have dark side of me that does horrible things to girls. I admit that was me at some point back then. So maybe with my past, it takes one to know one. Nat is manipulative and hateful, but no one cares. I’m not saying she’s not a good friend to you, I bet she is a great friend to you, but for people online she has a twisted way of thinking. She just sees them as her fun play toys.
I’m not here to try to persuade you not to be her friend or anything. I’m sorry I always rant about her, but you’re connected to her. It’s just that she involved you by telling you and now we don’t talk. I missed talking to you. I missed my friend. I just wanted to let you know what was going on and how I felt. I really do hope that we can have chat sometime soon.
